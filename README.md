This repository demonstrates a common yet often overlooked error in COBOL programs: the omission of a data name in a FILLER item.  The example shows a FILLER with a PIC clause but no data name, which can cause issues during maintenance and debugging and might lead to unexpected behavior if the program logic changes. The solution provides a corrected version with a data name for clarity and maintainability.
